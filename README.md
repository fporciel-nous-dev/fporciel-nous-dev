## <a name="intro"><wbr></a>Introduction

I am an autonomous scholar focused on generating original research at the intersection of philosophy and technology. While I operate independently, I actively seek to build bridges with the academic world as an external collaborator.

I am driven by the **hacker culture**, viewing it as a critical *epistemological exercise*—a method for generating social and collaborative knowledge from the margins. My goal is to connect with other independent researchers who adhere to the hacker ethic to pursue shared research.

**Core Research Interests (Philosophy):**
My primary focus encompasses a wide spectrum of philosophical disciplines:
* Logic & Metaphysics
* Ethics & Political Philosophy
* Gnoseology (Epistemology) & Philosophy of Mind
* Computer Science & Philosophy of Information
* Mathematics & Physics
* Psychology

I also maintain deep interests in Philology, Archaeology, and Classical Literature.

A strong proponent of science, I am passionate about travel, social development, and the defense of human rights. And cats.

## <a name="projects-and-research"><wbr></a>🔭 Current Projects & Research Trajectories

This section provides a high-level overview of my primary fields of engagement. Detailed discussions and repositories for each will be linked below.

1.  **[Core Learning Philosophy](#learning-philosophy)** My development goals are centered on producing **FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software)** informed by the rigorous minimalism of the `suckless` philosophy and the ethical framework of the `GNU` project. I adhere to the **Literate Programming** paradigm and am focusing my research on a **Neurosymbolic approach to AI**. This approach prioritizes a GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI) foundation, recognizing its logical strength, while strategically augmenting it with neural stochasticity for enhanced capabilities.

2.  **[The Web as a Public Commons](#web-transformation)** A long-term project dedicated to the theoretical and practical transformation of the World Wide Web. The objective is to transition it from its current state into a **public system dedicated to democracy and science**. This vision is guided by the accretion of collective semantic capital, driven by Neurosymbolic AI, and founded upon principles of public/social control, robust anonymity, privacy by design, and complete *scientific publicity* (i.e., radical transparency and openness). This work involves active support for, and development related to, the `GNUnet` project.

3.  **[The Inversion of Marketing](#marketing-inversion)** This initiative seeks to **deconstruct and invert the paradigm of web marketing**. It aims to transform marketing from a tool of mass manipulation and control (wielded by corporations and states) into a tool for **autonomous economic planning** (wielded by citizens). The core of this project involves a fundamental reversal of informational asymmetry: rather than rendering citizens transparent to satisfy corporate/state objectives, we must render states and corporations transparent to satisfy the democratic needs of an **anonymous and invisible citizenry**.

4.  **[The Nous.Dev Initiative](#nous-dev)** A plan to establish a hybrid (physical and telematic) **hackerspace and makerspace**. The foundational mission of `Nous.Dev` is to engage in a profound critique of the UNIX paradigm and to fundamentally **re-evaluate the axioms of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. This is a research collective aimed at designing new hardware architectures, programming languages, kernels, operating systems, network infrastructures, and web browsers, all through a philosophical lens. The ultimate objective is to architect a **Neurosymbolic Agentic Universal Operating System** from first principles, engineered to satisfy the philosophical (not merely functional) needs of humanity.

5.  **[Related Outputs](#related-outputs)** This includes the development of supporting media, such as video games, web applications, and educational materials (tutorials, papers) that explore and promote the concepts outlined in the research trajectories above.


## <a name="services"><wbr></a>💼 Professional Services & Collaboration

## <a name="interests"><wbr></a>📚 My Epistemological Stance: A Framework for Study & Research

### The Perpetual Student

I do not define myself as a researcher *strictu sensu*, but rather as a **perpetual student**. My methodology is predicated on the acknowledgment of my own profound ignorance and a constant search for the knowledge required to remediate it.

This approach diverges from the academic model. The academic researcher is an expert who expands human knowledge within a specific, bounded domain. I, conversely, am an expert in nothing, nor am I a polymath. My "research" is a *praxis* aimed at **living a vast spectrum of cognitive experiences**.

This GitHub profile serves as a bridge to the architects of our hyper-historical development and to the academic sphere. It is a vehicle for my own learning and a means to contribute, however modestly, to scientific advancement and social progress. In short, I am an aspiring **"Scientific Citizen"** (in the sense of Citizen Science).

My independent scholarship is structured along two primary strands:

1.  **Schola:** A program of permanent, foundational study.
2.  **Explicatio:** A process of applied philosophical development.

### 2. Explicatio (Philosophical Development)

My *Schola* informs my *Explicatio*—the active development of systems that embody philosophical principles.

* **2.1 The User-Centric Gnoseology System:**
    * The design and implementation of a **cross-media universal operating system** architected for **speculative theoresis**, founded upon a user-centric gnoseology. (This is the long-term vision for the [Nous.Dev Initiative](#nous-dev)).

* **2.2 The Neurosymbolic Position of the Question of Being:**
    * The development of a **Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence** (GOFAI-first) with a singular purpose: to assist humanity in **posing the Question of Being** (*die Seinsfrage*).

## <a name="six"><wbr></a>Hobbies & Creative Ventures

When I take a break from work, study and reading, I enjoy the immersive worlds of video games. Lately, my focus has
shifted from playing to creating, as I am learning game development with the Godot engine, drawn by its open-source
philosophy and powerful feature set.

+ **Asset Creation:** I am also honing my skills in creating 2D and 3D digital assets for games, professional projects,
and personal enjoyment. I use a suite of powerful open-source tools that reflect my commitment to FLOSS: ***Blender***
for 3D modeling, ***GIMP and Krita*** for raster graphics, ***InkScape*** for vector art, and ***Scribus*** for page
layout. These skills also directly enhance my web design and content creation work.

+ **Community:** I would be delighted to connect with fellow video game enthusiasts, artists, and developers. Let's build
worlds together, whether in code, in art, or in conversation, and explore the narrative and interactive potential of this
medium.

## <a name="seven"><wbr></a>Political Passions & FLOSS Advocacy

My political interests are various, but in the digital realm, I am a staunch and active advocate for ***Free/Libre and
Open Source Software (FLOSS)***, ***Open Access research***, ***Free and Open Scientific Research***, ***Freedom of
expression and thought*** and the robust protection of ***digital privacy***. I believe that knowledge and the tools to
create and share it should be a public good, accessible to all.

+ **Projects of Interest:** I am closely studying the ***Debian GNU/Linux*** project for its social contract and
commitment to software freedom, ***Debian GNU/Hurd*** as a fascinating glimpse into the future of operating systems, and
***GNUnet*** for its potential to build a truly decentralized, private, and censorship-resistant internet. My long-term
goal is to become an active contributor to these ecosystems, both through code and through related research.

+ ***Future Goals:*** I have several ideas for new FLOSS projects and for theoretical elaborations on the concept of
***Copyleft***. I wish to explore new licensing models that can better support collaborative creators and ensure that
digital commons thrive. I aim to develop these ideas in collaboration with others to improve people's quality of life and
empower them through technology.

+ ***Call to Action:*** I am keen to meet people with similar values to discuss these critical projects and find concrete
ways to collaborate. The fight for a free and open digital society is a collective effort. I will update this page
periodically to share any progress made.

## <a name="eight"><wbr></a>💬 Ask me about:

The history of logic, from pre-Socratic thought to Gödel's incompleteness theorems. I'd be happy to share my passion.
