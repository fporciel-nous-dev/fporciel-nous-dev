## <a name="one"><wbr></a>Independent Researcher in Philosophy, Hacking, and the Humanities</a>

I am an autonomous scholar focused on generating original research at the intersection of philosophy and technology. While I operate independently, I actively seek to build bridges with the academic world as an external collaborator.

I am driven by the **hacker culture**, viewing it as a critical *epistemological exercise*â€”a method for generating social and collaborative knowledge from the margins. My goal is to connect with other independent researchers who adhere to the hacker ethic to pursue shared research.

**Core Research Interests (Philosophy):**
My primary focus encompasses a wide spectrum of philosophical disciplines:
* Logic & Metaphysics
* Ethics & Political Philosophy
* Gnoseology (Epistemology) & Philosophy of Mind
* Computer Science & Philosophy of Information
* Mathematics & Physics
* Psychology

I also maintain deep interests in Philology, Archaeology, and Classical Literature.

A strong proponent of science, I am passionate about travel, social development, and the defense of human rights. And cats.

## <a name="two"><wbr></a>Professional Profile

I offer a range of professional services tailored to meet the needs of a diverse clientele, including Italian and
international companies, foundations, professionals, public entities, and individuals. My goal is to provide solutions
that are not only technically sound but also strategically and conceptually robust.

+ **Core Services:** My expertise lies in Web Marketing, Web Design, and Content Creation. This includes strategic SEO,
SEM, AIO, AAIO and Social Media campaigns, user-centric UI/UX design for responsive websites, blogs and newsletters, and
compelling content ranging from technical copywriting to multimedia storytelling. I am equipped to manage projects
independently from conception to completion or to integrate seamlessly and collaborate effectively as part of a larger
team.

+ **Custom Software:** I develop bespoke software solutions for a wide array of use cases. My approach is to build
tailored tools that solve specific, real-world challenges, focusing on creating software that is robust, scalable, and
intuitive. I believe that the best software emerges from a deep understanding of the user's needs and the context in which
it will be used.

+ **Collaboration:** I am always open to forming new collaborations and friendships with fellow enthusiasts in social
networking, web design, and the digital humanities. I am particularly interested in projects that lie at the intersection
of technology and the humanities, aiming to build tools and platforms that foster knowledge and community. If you have a
project or an idea in this space, I would be excited to connect and discuss it.

## <a name="three"><wbr></a>Intellectual Pursuits

Philosophy is the cornerstone of all my intellectual interests. I see it as the *science of sciences* â€” the discipline
that provides the foundational principles and critical framework for all other fields of knowledge. This perspective
guides my multidisciplinary studies, pushing me to seek connections and build a unified understanding.

+ **Professional Focus:** My work requires a deep and practical engagement with economics, marketing, computer science,
communication, and the Semantic Web. I approach these fields not just as technical domains but as complex systems of human
interaction and meaning-making.

+ **Passionate Studies:** In my personal time, I dedicate myself to the rigorous study of mathematics and, whenever
possible, various natural sciences. I have also delved into game design, metaphysics (exploring the fundamental nature of
being and reality), and both Aristotelian and modern logic (analyzing the architecture of sound reasoning). These are
fields in which I continuously seek to deepen my understanding.

+ **Classical Literature:** I hold a profound appreciation for Greek-Roman classical literature and am diligently working,
with considerable effort, to deepen my knowledge in this area. The wisdom of Stoic philosophers, the sharp analysis of
Roman historians, and the timeless human drama of Greek tragedies are constant sources of inspiration and intellectual
challenge.

+ **Seeking Connections:** I am eager to connect with individuals who share these interests for stimulating discussions,
forming study groups, or engaging in potential research collaborations. I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary
projects that bridge technology, philosophy, and classical studies.

+ **Current Project:** I am currently writing a philosophical book that aims to synthesize some of these diverse
interests. I hope to complete and publish it in the near future.

## <a name="four"><wbr></a>Languages

My passion for knowledge is intrinsically linked to the languages that encode it. Accessing texts and ideas in their
original form is paramount to a true understanding.

+ **Native:** Italian

+ **Learning:** I am actively studying English, French, German, Spanish, Arabic, Modern Greek, Ancient Greek, Latin, and
Russian. This endeavor is not merely academic; I am looking for conversation partners to practice and improve my fluency,
hoping to connect with diverse cultures on a deeper, more authentic level.

## <a name="five"><wbr></a>Tech Stack & Tools

My approach to technology is rooted in a desire for mastery and a preference for powerful, flexible, and transparent
tools. My programming paradigm of choice is **Literate Programming**, as I believe a program should be written for humans
to understand first, and only incidentally for machines to execute. To this end, I am studying the `noweb` framework to
publish code as literature.

+ **Programming Languages:** I use a range of languages, selecting them based on project needsâ€”from *C/C++* for
performance, to *Python* for data science, and *Rust* for its safety guarantees. The languages I'm currently focused on
include: ***Assembly, C, C++, C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, Bash, COBOL, Rust, PHP, Make, GNU Octave***.

+ **Markup & Databases:** ***LaTeX, HTML, MySQL, MariaDB***.

+ **Semantic Web:** I am deeply invested in the future of a machine-readable web, studying ***OWL*** and ***RDF*** to
build more intelligent and interconnected systems.

+ **Preferred Environment:** Debian GNU/Linux, for its stability, freedom, and robust community.

+ **Text Editors:** I primarily use Vim and Emacs. Vim for its modal efficiency and sheer power; Emacs for its
unparalleled extensibility and for the times when Vim's learning curve proves too steep.

## <a name="six"><wbr></a>Hobbies & Creative Ventures

When I take a break from work, study and reading, I enjoy the immersive worlds of video games. Lately, my focus has
shifted from playing to creating, as I am learning game development with the Godot engine, drawn by its open-source
philosophy and powerful feature set.

+ **Asset Creation:** I am also honing my skills in creating 2D and 3D digital assets for games, professional projects,
and personal enjoyment. I use a suite of powerful open-source tools that reflect my commitment to FLOSS: ***Blender***
for 3D modeling, ***GIMP and Krita*** for raster graphics, ***InkScape*** for vector art, and ***Scribus*** for page
layout. These skills also directly enhance my web design and content creation work.

+ **Community:** I would be delighted to connect with fellow video game enthusiasts, artists, and developers. Let's build
worlds together, whether in code, in art, or in conversation, and explore the narrative and interactive potential of this
medium.

## <a name="seven"><wbr></a>Political Passions & FLOSS Advocacy

My political interests are various, but in the digital realm, I am a staunch and active advocate for ***Free/Libre and
Open Source Software (FLOSS)***, ***Open Access research***, ***Free and Open Scientific Research***, ***Freedom of
expression and thought*** and the robust protection of ***digital privacy***. I believe that knowledge and the tools to
create and share it should be a public good, accessible to all.

+ **Projects of Interest:** I am closely studying the ***Debian GNU/Linux*** project for its social contract and
commitment to software freedom, ***Debian GNU/Hurd*** as a fascinating glimpse into the future of operating systems, and
***GNUnet*** for its potential to build a truly decentralized, private, and censorship-resistant internet. My long-term
goal is to become an active contributor to these ecosystems, both through code and through related research.

+ ***Future Goals:*** I have several ideas for new FLOSS projects and for theoretical elaborations on the concept of
***Copyleft***. I wish to explore new licensing models that can better support collaborative creators and ensure that
digital commons thrive. I aim to develop these ideas in collaboration with others to improve people's quality of life and
empower them through technology.

+ ***Call to Action:*** I am keen to meet people with similar values to discuss these critical projects and find concrete
ways to collaborate. The fight for a free and open digital society is a collective effort. I will update this page
periodically to share any progress made.

## <a name="eight"><wbr></a>ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:

The history of logic, from pre-Socratic thought to GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems. I'd be happy to share my passion.
